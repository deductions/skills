Skills management web applications using inference and semantic web techniques

Leverage on 
- https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/ ,
- the Linked Open Data ecosystem,
- SPARQL databases,
- basic RDFS / OWL inference,
- and domain specific rules.

The roadmap:
- a plain vanilla application with user entered skills and a skills search
- domain specific applications: medical doctors, scientific research
